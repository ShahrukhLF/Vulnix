|         <strong>Tracking by IP address</strong> is an experimental feature, enabled in <code>lib/TWiki.cfg</code>. It lets you combine open access to some functions, with authentication on others, with full user activity tracking:
|         Open, freeform editing is the essence of <a href="http://TWiki.org/cgi-bin/view/TWiki/WikiCulture">WikiCulture</a> - what makes TWiki different and often more effective than other collaboration tools. For that reason, it is strongly recommended that decisions to restrict read or write access to a web or a topic are made with care - the more restrictions, the less Wiki in the mix. Experience shows that <em>unrestricted write access</em> works very well because:
|         <li> <strong>authenticating and restricting selected webs only:</strong> Provide unrestricted viewing access to open webs, with authentication and restriction only on selected webs.
|         <img src="http://TWiki.org/p/pub/TWiki/TWikiDocGraphics/help.gif" border="0" alt="HELP" width="16" height="16" /> This method only works if the <code><b>view</b></code> script is authenticated, which means that all Users have to login, even for read-only access. (An open guest account, like <a href="http://TWiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Main/TWikiGuest">TWikiGuest</a>, can get around this, allowing anyone to login to a common account with, for example, view-only access for public webs.) <a href="http://TWiki.org/cgi-bin/view/TWiki/TWikiInstallationGuide">TWikiInstallationGuide</a> has more on Basic Authentication, using the <code><b>.htaccess</b></code> file.
|         Use the following setup to provide unrestricted viewing access to open webs, with authentication only on selected webs:
|         <li> <img src="http://TWiki.org/p/pub/TWiki/TWikiDocGraphics/warning.gif" border="0" alt="ALERT!" width="16" height="16" /> <strong>NOTE:</strong> The opening and closing angle brackets - <code><b>&lt;...&gt;</b></code> - of an HTML tag <strong><em>must be on the same line</em></strong>, or the tag will be broken.
|         TWikiVariables are text strings - <code>%VARIABLE%</code> - that expand into content whenever a page is opened. When a topic is rendered for viewing, <code>VARIABLES</code> are replaced by data, either user-entered, or info automatically generated by TWiki (like the date, or the current username). There are predefined variables, and Preference variables that you configure. You can also define custom variables, with new names and values. 
|         <li> With <code><b>WEBFORMS</b></code> enabled, an extra button is added to the edit view. If the topic doesn't have a Form, an <strong>Add Form</strong> button appears at the end of the topic. If a Form is present, a <strong>Change</strong> button appears in the top row of the Form. The buttons open a screen that enables selection of a form specified in <code>WEBFORMS</code>, or the <strong>No form</strong> option.
|         To eliminate the incompatibility problems bound to arise from active open Plugin development, a Plugin versioning system and an API <code>GetVersion</code> detection routine are provided for automatic compatibility checking.
